# Part 4 / BlogList Backend

This is my submission for the Full Stack Open [Course](https://fullstackopen.com/en) 2020, part 4.

This is the server for a blog list web application. 

The application will allow users to save information about interesting blogs they have stumbled across on the internet.

Check out the application. [COMING SOON]

## Learning focus

- project structure best practices
- **Jest** library for unit testing Node
- `supertest` library to test API endpoints
- setup and teardown functions
- `async`/`await` syntax

## Notes

- Jest isn't probably the ideal tool for testing Node applications, but it will do for now

## Stack

Uses Node.js v12.18.3 with Express.

Javascript follows ES6 specifications.

Database is a MongoDB managed with Mongoose.

Tested with Jest.

## Usage

First clone the project and navigate to root directory.

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run:

```
npm run dev
```

The server will run on [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003).

## Improvements and beyond
